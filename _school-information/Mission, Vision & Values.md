<h3>School Mission, Vision &amp; Values</h3>
<h3><strong>Our Mission</strong></h3>
<p><em>Growing Our Hearts and Minds</em>
</p>
<p>In Yuhua Primary School, we strive to provide Yuhualites with a holistic
education, focused both on academic and non-academic areas. The total curriculum
of the school centres on building good character&nbsp;(Heart)&nbsp;in our
students as well as nurturing their passion for learning (Mind). We believe
these two important aspects are interdependent and crucial in moulding
the future of our nation. Staff in the school takes pride in ‘walking’
this belief alongside young Yuhualites, being good role models for the
students and growing together with them.</p>
<h3><strong>Our Vision</strong></h3>
<p><em>An Yuhualite who Cares, Shares and Contributes;</em>&nbsp;<em>Learns, Thinks and Innovates</em>
</p>
<p>The school wants to give Yuhualites a broad range of experiences and help
them make the most of their years together in school where they will interact
with one another and form strong friendships for life. As they grow up,
we want to provide them with the full opportunity to develop the skills,
values and the right attitudes that they will need for life. An Yuhualite
will graduate as a person who has respect for self, others and the environment
(Cares). He is gracious and generous (Shares). He gives his best to his
family, school, community and nation, Singapore (Contributes). He is a
motivated and self-directed learner (Learns). He is reflective,critical
and creative in his thinking (Thinks). He constantly seeks improvement
and pursues excellence (Innovates).</p>
