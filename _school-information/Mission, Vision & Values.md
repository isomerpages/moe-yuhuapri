### School Mission, Vision & Values

### **Our Mission**

_Growing Our Hearts and Minds_

In Yuhua Primary School, we strive to provide Yuhualites with a holistic education, focused both on academic and non-academic areas. The total curriculum of the school centres on building good character (Heart) in our pupils as well as nurturing their passion for learning (Mind). We believe these two important aspects are interdependent and crucial in moulding the future of our nation. Staff in the school takes pride in ‘walking’ this belief alongside young Yuhualites, being good role models for the pupils and growing together with them.

### **Our Vision**

_Yuhualite: One who Cares, Shares and Contributes;_ _One who Learns, Thinks and Innovates_

The school wants to give Yuhualites a broad range of experiences and help them make the most of their years together in school where they will interact with one another and form strong friendships for life. As they grow up, we want to provide them with the full opportunity to develop the skills, values and the right attitudes that they will need for life. An Yuhualite will graduate as a person who has respect for self, others and the environment (Cares). He is gracious and generous (Shares). He gives his best to his family, school, community and nation, Singapore (Contributes). He is a motivated and self-directed learner (Learns). He is reflective,critical and creative in his thinking (Thinks). He constantly seeks improvement and pursues excellence (Innovates).
