### Principal's Message

<img src="/images/principal.png" style="width:183px;height:2=340px;margin-left:15px;" align = "right"> Dear Parents and Guardians,

A very warm welcome back to the new school year for 2022! 

We would also like to extend our warmest welcome to our new students and staff who have just joined our Yuhua Primary Family.

Steeped in a rich heritage of contributing to the community, Yuhua Primary School, first established as Joo Hwa Public School in 1930, came to being due to the help and support of community leaders, businessmen and the residents in old Jurong, who all believed in paying-it-forward. Many years down memory lane, with the merger of Yuqun Primary School, this continues to be part of Yuhua Primary’s DNA where we are passionate about growing the hearts and minds of our students. Developing them as they grow in wisdom and stature as we imbue in them the joy and love for learning, and guiding them as they make a positive difference regardless of their youth as we nurture good character and values in them to serve as their compass in life.

Together with our dedicated staff and unwavering support from our stakeholders, we will forge ahead with our school’s mission, “**Growing our Hearts and Minds**”. At the same time, stay committed to our course in nurturing our students to **care, share and contribute**, to encourage them to **learn, think and innovate,** and to develop them to be **motivated and innovative learners, caring contributors** anchored in the strong values of **Respect****, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care, and Harmony**. 

As an alumnus of Yuhua Primary, I am filled with deep honour and gladness that I am given the privilege to return in a new capacity to lead, care and serve with our caring and capable team of staff with shared beliefs that every child of ours is unique, precious and can flourish and bloom to be the best that they can be at every life stage. We will also endeavour to strengthen and enhance our school-home partnership with our parents, as you play a pivotal role in developing our children holistically, giving them a strong foundation to thrive as they grow and mature in life.

Borrowing the words of Ralph Waldo Emerson:

**Sow a thought, reap an action;**

**Sow an action, reap a habit;**

**Sow a habit, reap a character;**

**Sow a character, reap a destiny.**

Using the metaphor of a garden (school) and gardener (parents, staff and stakeholders), we look forward to your continual support as we jointly help our seedlings (children) bloom, flourish and thrive in a safe and conducive learning environment in school and at home.

We wish you and family well.

Your Partner-in-Education,

Mrs Ruth Tai

Principal

Yuhua Primary School
