<p>Dear Parents and Guardians,</p>
<p>Welcome back to the new school year for 2025!</p>
<p>We would also like to extend our warmest welcome to our new students and
staff who have just joined our Yuhua Primary Family.</p>
<p>This year is especially exciting for all of us as we are celebrating our
95<sup>th</sup> School Anniversary! It will be even more meaningful and
memorable for me as I am an alumnus of Yuhua Primary, including my elder
sister who also studied in Yuqun Primary, now merged with Yuhua since 2002.
Together with our Yuhua Family of Yuhualites, staff and stakeholders, we
are truly looking forward to the purposeful activities leading up to, and
culminating with our actual day celebrations in late April this year.</p>
<p>Join us on our school’s Facebook or Instagram page and be part of our
celebrations.</p>

<p>Over here at Yuhua, we continue to stay passionate about growing the hearts
and minds of our students. Developing them as they grow in wisdom and stature
as we imbue in them the joy of and love for learning, and guiding them
as they make a positive difference regardless of their youth as we nurture
good character and values in them to serve as their compass in life.</p>
<p>Together with our dedicated staff and unwavering support from our stakeholders,
we will forge ahead with our school’s mission, “Growing our Hearts and
Minds”. At the same time, stay committed to our course in nurturing our
students to care, share and contribute, to encourage them to learn, think
and innovate, anchored in the strong values of Respect, Responsibility,
Resilience, Integrity, Care, and Harmony.</p>
<p>Undergirding these ideals will be our student ‘ACHIEVE’ outcomes that
have been derived from the Student ‘ACHIEVE’ Framework (please see below),
unique to Yuhua Primary School. The framework stemmed from the collective
efforts of our staff, students, the SAC and the PSG. These envisioned shared
goals encapsulate what we hope every Yuhualite can achieve during their
time with us as they strive across learning challenges and shine at their
personal brightest through their talents and strengths.</p>
<p>With this framework, the school continually aligns, relooks into and refines
our total curriculum plans and key learning programmes so as to help us
actualise the shared belief that ‘Every Yuhualite Can ACHIEVE’.</p>

<p>Using the metaphor of a garden (school) and gardener (parents and guardians,
staff and stakeholders), we look forward to your continual support as we
jointly help our seedlings (children) bloom, flourish and thrive in a safe
and conducive learning environment in school and at home. Please allow
me to share with you the story of the bamboo plant. Even with daily watering
and fertilising the plant in the ground where it has been planted, it does
not break through the ground for five years. For five long years, the gardener
might not see any signs of growth from the ground level. But after five
years, once the bamboo plant breaks through the ground, it can grow at
a staggering speed of about 120 centimetres every day, reaching about 27
metres in just 5 weeks! And the bamboo is such a useful plant as it can
be eaten, made into fibre for clothing, planted to reduce soil erosion,
used as a replacement for wood, just to name a few of its uses.</p>
<p>On a similar note, our children need to be given time and space to develop,
grow, blossom and eventually flourish when they are ready. As their educators,
parents and guardians, let us continually partner one another to provide
them with this conducive home-school environment, while role-modelling
exemplary behaviour, thoughts and actions to support and encourage them
in the growth of their hearts and minds.</p>
<p>As members of our collective “Yuhua Village” and family, we thank you
for your unwavering support and in partnering us to grow our Yuhualites
holistically with the common goal to see them internalise life-long learning,
and be well-poised to flourish in life, looking beyond self, and actively
contributing to their home, school and community from young.</p>
<p>We wish you and family well.</p>
<p>Your Partner-in-Education,</p>
<p>Mrs Ruth Tai</p>
<p>Principal</p>
<p>Yuhua Primary School</p>
