### Principal's Message

<img src="/images/principal.png" style="width:183px;height:2=340px;margin-left:15px;" align = "right"> Dear Parents and Guardians,

A very warm welcome back to the new school year for 2023! 

We would also like to extend our warmest welcome to our new students and staff who have just joined our Yuhua Primary Family.

Over the course of last year and moving into the new year, we at Yuhua continue to stay passionate about growing the hearts and minds of our students. Developing them as they grow in wisdom and stature as we imbue in them the joy and love for learning, and guiding them as they make a positive difference regardless of their youth as we nurture good character and values in them to serve as their compass in life.

Together with our dedicated staff and unwavering support from our stakeholders, we will forge ahead with our school’s mission, “**Growing our Hearts and Minds**”. At the same time, stay committed to our course in nurturing our students to **care, share and contribute**, to encourage them to **learn, think and innovate,** and to develop them to be **active contributors, values-driven leaders,** **independent learners and critical thinkers**, anchored in the strong values of **Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care, and Harmony**. 

Following the re-envisioning exercise conducted with our staff, and gathering input from our students, SAC and PSG, we have also further unpacked and clearly delineated our collective goal of helping our students to ‘ACHIEVE’ during their time of learning with us at Yuhua Primary. We will be aligning all of our school’s efforts, strategic plans and programmes to our **Student ACHIEVE Framework** as shown below.

Using the metaphor of a garden (school) and gardener (parents and guardians, staff and stakeholders), we look forward to your continual support as we jointly help our seedlings (children) bloom, flourish and thrive in a safe and conducive learning environment in school and at home. Please allow me to share with you the story of the bamboo plant. Even with daily watering and fertilizing the plant in the ground where it has been planted, it does not break through the ground for five years. For five long years, the gardener might not see any signs of growth from the ground level. But after five years, once the bamboo plant breaks through the ground, it can grow at a staggering speed of about 120 centimetres every day, reaching about 27 metres in just 5 weeks! And the bamboo is such a useful plant as it can be eaten, made into fibre for clothing, planted to reduce soil erosion, used as a replacement for wood, just to name a few of its uses.

On a similar note, our children need to be given time and space to develop, grow and eventually flourish when they are ready. As their educators, parents and guardians, let us continually partner one another to provide them with this conducive home-school environment, while role-modelling exemplary behaviour, thoughts and actions to support and encourage them in the growth of their hearts and minds.

As the saying goes, “It takes a village to raise a child.”, and our Yuhua community can indeed be akin to an “Yuhua Village” as proudly displayed on the archway in front of the Yuhua market vicinity. Thank you for your unwavering support over the years and we look forward to many more good years ahead as a school in our Yuhua Village!

   

We wish you and family well.

Your Partner-in-Education,

Mrs Ruth Tai

Principal

Yuhua Primary School
