### School Song

*Audio clip to be inserted here*

Here is where we grow and serve

With a strong passion for life

With strength in character that takes us far

Creative in our thoughts

Innovative in our ways

Yuhua is where we grow our heart and mind

Rise above all

Illuminate and dazzle

Yuhualites stand tall

With love and light to lead us

Rise above all

Yuhua is where we grow our heart and mind

Yuhua our home it’s here that we belong

United as one Yuhua

Life-long learners we’ll be

Hand in hand, we can achieve our goals

Together we will strive

Forever do our best!

Yuhua is where we grow our heart and mind

Yuhua our home it’s here that we belong
