<h3><strong>SwimSafer Programme</strong></h3>
<p>Swimming is part of the PE curriculum. Students will acquire basic swimming
skills, water safety awareness and gain water confidence. By the end of
the programme, students would have gone through 8 swimming lessons. Each
of the 8 lessons in the SwimSafer Programme will last for 1.5 hours. Qualified
swimming coaches will conduct the swimming lessons at a Swimming Complex.
Teachers will accompany the students and ensure their safety. Those who
have attained SwimSafer Stage 1 proficiency before attending this programme
will learn the skills for the next stage.</p>
<p>At the end of the course, each child will be tested and only those who
pass both the theory and practical tests will be awarded the e-Certificate.</p>
<h4><strong>Retrieval of SwimSafer 2.0 e-Certificate</strong></h4>
<p>When the student has successfully passed both the Practical and Theory
components of the SwimSafer stage he/she is assigned, parents will receive
an email from <strong>FileSG with the transaction ID.</strong> &nbsp;Students
would have indicated their parents’ email and contact number when they
logged in to attempt their Theory Component <a href="https://go.gov.sg/sstheory" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/sstheory</a> at home.</p>
<p>Once the theory quiz is completed and you have received the email from
FileSG, please kindly follow the steps below to retrieve the e-certificate
from the FileSG webpage.</p>
<p>You will need to select the “<strong>Retrieve without Singpass</strong>”
option. You will not be able to retrieve the file if you are logging in
