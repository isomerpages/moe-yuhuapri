<p><strong>Overview</strong>
</p>
<p>The main objective of Track and Field Club is to develop skills in track
and field events such as sprints, jumps and throws. Through the weekly
practices, members extend what they have learnt in the athletics modules
during PE lessons and become more proficient. They live the motto of Olympics
– run faster, jump higher and throw further. Beyond skills and physical
fitness, members learn sportsmanship and teamwork. Athletics Club hopes
to imbue the passion for sports in pupils and contribute to nurturing future
sportsman and sportswomen for Singapore.</p>
<p>The fitness and conditioning activities and advance training will prepare
those with talents in Athletics to compete in the Inter Primary Schools
Track and Field Championships.</p>
