<p><strong>Overview</strong>
</p>
<p>Our Objectives:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To encourage participation from the Primary 3 to Primary 6 girls of all
abilities and to sustain their interest in&nbsp;netball.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To continually develop our players on their technical and mental skills
which are essential for&nbsp;netball.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Programme:
<br>Netball&nbsp;is a team sport that fosters team-spirit, trains agility
and resilience. We aim to develop our playersâ€™&nbsp;netball&nbsp;skills
and nurture them to their fullest potential through our&nbsp;netball&nbsp;training
that takes place twice a week. Players will be expected to compete at a
level appropriate to their abilities in competitions and carnivals. Our
players will strive to uphold the school values of a R3ICH attitude as
well as to adopt an attitude of fair play and good sportsmanship in the
game.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Netball&nbsp;Club provides girls with an opportunity to participate
in sports. Through the practices, members will improve in throwing and
catching, shooting, and attack and defensive play. As they gain confidence
in playing the game, they can take part in&nbsp;netball&nbsp;carnivals
and Inter-Primary Schools&nbsp;Netball&nbsp;Championships.</p>
