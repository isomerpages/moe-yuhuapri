<p>Yuhua Football CCA aims to foster physical, social, and emotional development
of the pupils. Engaging in football training sessions enhances coordination
and overall fitness. The sport requires running, dribbling, and quick movements,
which improve strength, balance, and agility.</p>
<p>Football is a team-oriented sport that teaches children the importance
of collaboration and communication. Players learn to work together towards
a common goal, building friendships amongst the members. Regular practice
instills discipline and responsibility in young players. They learn the
value of commitment, punctuality, and respect for coaches and teammates.</p>
