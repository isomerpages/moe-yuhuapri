<p><strong>Overview</strong>
</p>
<p>The Debate and Public Speaking Club seeks to equip members with the essential
knowledge, skills and values through engaging speaking and debating activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CCA offers a dynamic and supportive space for students to build confidence,
express themselves creatively, and collaborate with others through the
performing arts. Each session begins with vocal warm-ups—including engaging
tongue twisters—to improve articulation, clarity, and vocal projection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students take part in a variety of dramatization activities such as freeze
frames, role-play, and improvisation. These exercises help students explore
storytelling, enhance their use of body language and voice, and develop
teamwork and creative thinking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To strengthen public speaking skills, students are introduced to monologue
performances where they learn to deliver speeches with expression and confidence.
As they progress, students are gradually exposed to basic debate formats,
encouraging them to organize their thoughts, present arguments clearly,
and listen actively to others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Debate and Public Speaking Club aims to nurture confident and empathetic
communicators and thoughtful team players, preparing them to shine both
on and off stage.&nbsp;</p>
