<h3>Indian Dance</h3>
<p>The Indian Dance Club provides members with exposure to Indian culture
and dance forms. The Club aims to develop an appreciation of Indian classical
and folk dance. Members learn the basic Bharatanatyam steps and other dance
skills. The practices provide opportunities for pupils to develop self-confidence
and good character. They learn to work together as a team.</p>
<p>The dancers also learn folk and contemporary Indian dance steps and are
exposed to different dance forms. Through dance members learn and demonstrate
the school values.</p>
<p>Our aspiring dancers showcase their talents and skills during school events
like Annual Prize Giving Day. They also have the opportunity to participate
in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation as well as performing
during community events.</p>
