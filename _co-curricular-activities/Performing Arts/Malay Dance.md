<p>The Malay Dance Club provides members with exposure to Malay traditional
dance forms and to develop an appreciation of Malay culture. Members learn
the basic dance skills. The practices provide opportunities for pupils
to develop self-confidence and good character. They learn to work together
as a team. Through dance members learn and demonstrate the school values.</p>
<p>The dancers can showcase their talents and skills during school events
like Annual Prize Giving Day. They also have the opportunity to participate
in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation as well as performing
during community events.</p>
