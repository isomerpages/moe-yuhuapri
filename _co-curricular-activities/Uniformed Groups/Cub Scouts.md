<p><strong>Overview</strong>
</p>
<p>The Yuhua Cub Scouts programme seeks to inculcate in cub scouts, a value
system based upon principles expressed in the Scout Promise and Law, and
our school values.</p>
<p>We use the Scout Method of Learning by Doing – a hands-on experiential
programme in the outdoors to enable cub scout to take charge of his/her
own development into self-reliant, supportive, responsible and committed
persons. Our Cub Scout Programme Scheme includes assessments in the areas
of Citizenship, Leadership, Responsibility, Physical Skills, Self-Reliance,
Adventure and Fun. An Award Scheme, comprising a series of badges to give
cub scouts knowledge of basic Scouting skills and mark their achievements
in areas such as camp craft, team-building games, citizenship and improving
the environment is incorporated into the CCA programme.</p>
<p>The activities Cub Scouts partake in include hiking, camps, camp craft,
and activities organised the Scout Headquarters.</p>
