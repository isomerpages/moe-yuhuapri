### Social Studies

Socially responsible citizens feel a sense of belonging to Singapore through knowing and loving Singapore and seeing beyond their personal interests to care for their family and community. Drawing on aspects of society that are of meaning and interest to the pupils, Social Studies (SS) seeks to ignite pupilsâ€™ curiosity to inquire into real-world issues that concern their lives. Through inquiry and authentic learning experiences, SS helps pupils to attain relevant knowledge and understanding about these issues, develop critical and reflective thinking skills, and appreciate multiple perspectives. Pupils will have a deeper understanding of the values that define the Singapore society, nurture dispositions that will inspire them to show concern for the society and the world in which they live, and demonstrate empathy in their relationships with others.

Field-based learning (FbL) allows pupils to contextualise their learning experience in an authentic real-world setting, thus enabling the relational learning of concepts and content. These educational experiences and opportunities to visit heritage sites and national institutions allow pupils to reflect on the challenges Singapore faced in the past and how, as a country, we have progressed and attained success through the years. FbL also motivates and sustains their interest in the subject matter as pupils learn to explore, construct new knowledge and make connections to the topics being studied. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the pupils went on e-Learning Journeys (LJ).
