### English Language

**Overview**

The English Department has a vision to develop our Yuhualites to be Communicative and Confident Learners through the four skills of Speaking, Listening, Reading and Writing.

Our programmes aim to build a strong foundation in the English Language among Yuhualites while providing them with a rich language learning experience to develop a love for learning the language.

**Curriculum**

The key approach to the teaching and learning of the English Language is through the STELLAR (Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading) Approach.

STELLAR aims to build in children a love for reading and a strong foundation in the English Language. At the heart of the STELLAR programme is the belief that enjoyment is a fundamental aspect of shared reading and writing experience. Through STELLAR, we hope that our Yuhualites will experience the joy of learning as they become communicative and confident learners.
