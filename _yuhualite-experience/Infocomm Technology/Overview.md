### ICT Programme

**ICT in Teaching & Learning**

ICT is an integral part of teaching and learning in YHPS.  Across subjects, teachers leverage ICT to enhance lessons, increase efficacy and engage pupils with the purpose of deepening student’s learning. We aim to achieve quality ICT-enabled learning in every level and nurture pupils with the appropriate dispositions to harness ICT for life-long learning.

**Baseline ICT Standards (New Media Literacies)**

The standards has its focus on the acquisition and application of technical skills to support the creation of digital content and various modes of interaction. It details the skills, knowledge, attitude and values (SKAV) that pupils should apply and demonstrate when harnessing ICT for learning and interacting; curating digital content; connecting and communicating digitally; and creating digital multimodal products.

New Media Literacies have been defined as the abilities to curate, create and connect with others in the digital networked environment. Curate, Create and Connect are ways of interacting in the digital networked environment. Regular engagement in these interactions will enable pupils to develop an understanding of the social practices governing the digital networked environment.

The six values at the core of MOE’s 21st Century Competencies Framework undergird the values that pupils should have. These values shape their participation in the digital networked environment.

The six values are:

|  |  |
|---|---|
| **Respect** | Believes in one’s self-worth and the intrinsic worth of all members in the community |
| **Responsibility** | Recognises the duty to oneself and community, fulfilling one’s responsibilities with love and commitment |
| **Resilience** | Possesses the emotional strength to persevere in the face of challenges Manifests courage, optimism, adaptability and resourcefulness |
| **Integrity** | Upholds ethical principles and has the moral courage to stand up for what is right |
| **Care** | Makes discerning choices and moves beyond self-interest to improve the community |
| **Harmony** | Appreciates diversity and seeks social cohesion in the new media ecology |

At the end of their six-year education in Yuhua Primary School, a pupil would have acquired these competencies:

|  |  |
|---|---|
| 1. | The pupil is able to conduct internet searches and organize the digital information for ease of retrieval, while recognizing copyright regulations governing the use of digital information. |
| 2. | The pupil is able to verify the accuracy, credibility and currency of a piece of information. |
| 3. | The pupil is able to select and put together different media elements to construct a digital artefact, while making informed choices with regard to how to use information ethically. |
| 4. | The pupil is able to exchange digital information with others synchronously and asynchronously, while observing proper etiquette. |
| 5. | The pupil is able to manage the digital footprint he/she makes when sharing information online. |

**Developing Future-ready Learners**

**F.L.I.G.H.T.@1656** is a signature two-pronged programme that engages, enhances and extend students’ learning experiences. Students get to synthesise their knowledge and create digital learning artefacts that value-add to their learning. Customised tasks are curated to bring forth level-appropriate New Media Literacies (Baseline ICT Standards), Project Work Skills as well as English Language literacy application.

**F.L.I.G.H.T. 1,2,3!** is the foundation of the whole-school F.L.I.G.H.T.@1656 programme to drive ICT skills and innovative learning experiences for the pupils. As this component targets the younger learners in our school, we gave them a less abstract setting to work on and tap on their learning content from their English Language curriculum as a springboard to challenge them to more innovative learning experiences and outcomes.

The students here are working remotely to access shared documents and give individual inputs, with their teacher’s assistance, to value-add to a group task.

**F.L.I.G.H.T. 4,5,6!** is the next stage to drive innovative and critical thinking skills via coding-based lessons and challenges. As pupils have had experience with F.L.I.G.H.T. 1,2,3!, we gave them a more abstract setting to work on or with. Equipped with micro:bits, students were given socio-environmental contexts to work with to bring forth empathy, passion and critical thinking in their  solutions generation.

**TechPlay 1,2,3!**

TechPlay 1,2,3! is the enrichment arm of the F.L.I.G.H.T. programme, aimed at encouraging innovative and critical thinking through coding for the Primary 1 to 3 students. Carried out at the year’s end, the students get to experience coding via various means from tactile to line coding to enhance their thinking processes and pique their interest in this area over the formative years.
