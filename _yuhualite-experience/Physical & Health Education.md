#### Programmes

#### Physical Health and Fitness Education

PHF is a component of the PE Programme where pupils acquire knowledge and skills to empower them to lead healthy lifestyles and take responsibility for the health and well-being of others and the environment. They exhibit good health habits and practise good nutrition.

#### SwimSafer Programme

Swimming is part of the PE curriculum. Pupils will acquire basic swimming skills and water safety awareness and gain water confidence. By the end of Primary 6, pupils would have gone through 12 swimming lessons. Each lesson will last for an hour. Qualified swimming coaches will conduct the swimming lessons at a Swimming Complex. Teachers will accompany the pupils and ensure their safety.

At the end of the course, each child will be tested and only those who pass the test will be awarded. Those who have already attained SwimSafer Stage 1 proficiency before attending this programme will learn the skills for the next stage.
