### Choir

The School Choir seeks to instill in the students the joy of singing and build good character.During the practices, members learn proper singing techniques. Basic music theory is taught and applied. Fun and interesting drills are introduced to the training programme. Learning different genres and languages of new songs require resilience, patience and attentiveness. Members demonstrated care for one another during sectional practice. There are opportunities for leadership development as members take on the role of section leaders and leadership positions in the committee.

Opportunities are plenty for the choir to participate in performances, internal and external. The Choir showcase our talents during the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation. Â We participate in many public performances, contributing to the community.
