<h4><strong>Environmental Science Club CCA</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Empower, Inspire, and Make a Difference</strong>
</p>
<p>The Environmental Science Club (ESC) provides the opportunities for Yuhualites
to become a proactive eco-steward and inspire positive change. The ESC
aims to educate, empower, and engage individuals in sustainable practices.
We believe that by fostering a deeper understanding of environmental science,
we can inspire meaningful action that extends beyond our club –positively
impacting family, school and the broader community.</p>
<p>During ESC CCA sessions, members can gain hands-on experience with sustainability
projects, conservation efforts, and eco-friendly practices. They are then
encouraged to lead by example and help others adopt green habits that protect
our Earth. These are some of the activities that the ESC can partake in:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recycling: tending to the
Book Swap corner to encourage reading through book donations, composting
and others</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upcycling: attending workshops
to learn the skills to reuse and repurpose used items</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Observing sustainable farm-to-table
practice: tending and growing in traditional and vertical farms in school</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advocating positive change:
creating posters and messages, participating in green challenges and engaging
peers during events, that promote a green and more sustainable lifestyle</p>
<p>Be a part of something bigger—something that will shape a better world
for all, and take your first step towards a greener future!</p>
