### Indian Dance

The Indian Dance Club provides members with exposure to Indian culture and dance forms. The Club aims to develop an appreciation of Indian classical and folk dance. Members learn the basic Bharatanatyam steps and other dance skills. The practices provide opportunities for pupils to develop self-confidence and good character. They learn to work together as a team.

The dancers also learn folk and contemporary Indian dance steps and are exposed to different dance forms. Through dance members learn and demonstrate the school values.

Our aspiring dancers showcase their talents and skills during school events like Annual Prize Giving Day. They also have the opportunity to participate in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation as well as performing during community events.
