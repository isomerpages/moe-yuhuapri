### Art & Crafts

Art and Crafts Club seeks to build members’ interest in art-making and appreciation of art. In art club, members are introduced to a wide variety of different art forms through the art-making activities. The art-making activities that members are exposed to include painting, drawing, printmaking, design and craftwork.

During the process of art-making, not only do members learn the various art-making techniques and experiment with the different mediums, they also get to exercise their creativity in creating interesting artworks. Guidance are provided to the members to cultivate critical thinking, creative expression and encourage members to become artists that are self-directed in learning.
