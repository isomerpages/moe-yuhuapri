### Track and Field

#### Overview

The main objective of Track and Field Club is to develop skills in track and field events such as sprints, jumps and throws. Through the weekly practices, members extend what they have learnt in the athletics modules during PE lessons and become more proficient. They live the motto of Olympics – run faster, jump higher and throw further. Beyond skills and physical fitness, members learn sportsmanship and team work. Athletics Club hopes to imbue the passion for sports in pupils and contribute to nurturing future sportsman and sportswomen for Singapore.

The fitness and conditioning activities and advance training will prepare those with talents in Athletics to compete in the Inter Primary Schools Track and Field Championships. In 2014, our member, Ezra Ho (6F 2014) came in 3rd for 100m B-Division event and 4th for 200m B-Division event at the National Primary Track and Field Championships.
