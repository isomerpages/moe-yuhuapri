The Sepak Takraw CCA programme seeks to equip pupils with basic game skills and concepts such as supporting team play and making use of space. It also develops pupilâ€™s social emotional competencies and provides an avenue to inculcate our school values.

The members comprises of beginning players and school team players. The two groups go through a different training programme which is progressive and allowing the new members to learn the basics and develop the potential of the skilful players.

The Club aimed to produce all-round individuals who have skilful players, good decision makers, and resilient.
