### Volleyball

The Volleyball Club seeks to develop good character through sports and build membersâ€™ physical fitness and inspire passion for the game.

We have a systematic and differentiated training programme to cater to pupils of different abilities so that all will acquire skills in volleyball at their own pace and enjoy the game.

Pupils who have progressed sufficiently are selected to participate in volleyball competitions such as games carnivals and the Inter-Primary Schools Volleyball Championships.
