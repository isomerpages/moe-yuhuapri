### Co-Curricular Activities

#### Overview

The CCA programme provides students with a platform to discover their interests and talents. CCA can instill in the individual a life-long love for a particular activity, be it a sport or a musical pursuit. This helps the individual to lead a balanced life in adulthood.

The CCA programme aims to achieve the following objectives:

*   Teach knowledge and skills relevant to the CCA
*   Inculcate values and desirable social attitudes in all pupils; and
*   Provide healthy recreational activities

The learning outcomes for CCA are as follows:

Students will develop and demonstrate:

*   Passion
*   Leadership and teamwork
*   Friendship and belonging
*   Spirit of service to the community
*   Knowledge, skills and values related to their chosen CCA
*   Core values, social and emotional competencies and the emerging 21st century competencies as articulated in the 21st Century Competencies Framework

To achieve this, we have 4 categories of CCAs for the pupils to choose from:

*   **Sports & Games**  
    Athletics, Badminton, Basketball, Football, Netball, Volleyball, Sepak Takraw
*   **Clubs & Societies**  
    Art Club, ICT & Media Club
*   **Performing Arts**  
    Angklung Ensemble, Brass Band, Choir, Chinese Dance, Malay Dance, Indian Dance
*   **Uniformed Groups**  
    Cub Scouts

**Participation in CCA**

CCA is an integral part of our education system. Every student from P3 to P6 will get to participate in one CCA.

Students are strongly encouraged to participate actively in their CCA to develop their interests and talents. Students who display talents in their CCA may be selected to represent the school for competitions.

**CCA Practices and Meetings**

Students have CCA Practice/Meeting once a week, for about one and a half hours, on Tuesday mornings during curriculum hours between 8am to 9.30am (subject to changes).

For some CCAs which require more practices to develop competency in skills or to prepare for competitions, students have to attend practices twice a week. The second practice is on either a Wednesday or Friday afternoon between 2pm to 4pm (subject to changes). CCAs are conducted in the school.

CCA practices/meetings will stand down 2 weeks before the examinations and resume after the examinations.

**CCA Recruitment**

At the end of Primary Two, students will get to find out more about the various CCAs. They will then be given a form to select their choices. The students are encouraged to discuss their choices of CCA with their parents before the parents submit their CCA choices online.

The school will try to assign the CCAs according to pupilsâ€™ preference. However, there may be instances when students may not be assigned their first choice CCA if it is over-subscribed. In such cases, they will be assigned to one of their remaining choices of CCA.
