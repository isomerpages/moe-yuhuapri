### Malay Dance

The Malay Dance Club provides members with exposure to Malay traditional dance forms and to develop an appreciation of Malay culture. Members learn the basic dance skills. The practices provide opportunities for pupils to develop self-confidence and good character. They learn to work together as a team. Through dance members learn and demonstrate the school values.

The dancers can showcase their talents and skills during school events like Annual Prize Giving Day. They also have the opportunity to participate in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation as well as performing during community events.
