### Chinese Dance

The Chinese Dance Club aims to cultivate an interest in a variety of traditional dance and impart valuable cultural heritage in members. Through age appropriated physical training and working as one harmonious team, we build good character. Members have opportunities to develop their leadership potential and self-confidence.

Our Chinese dancers have achieved outstanding accomplishments in Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation and have participated in many public performances, contributing to the community.
