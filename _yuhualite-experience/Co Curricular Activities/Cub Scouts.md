### Cub Scouts

**Overview**

The Yuhua Cub Scouts programme seeks to inculcate in cub scouts, a value system based upon principles expressed in the Scout Promise and Law, and our school values.

We use the Scout Method of Learning by Doing – a hands-on experiential programme in the outdoors to enable cub scout to take charge of his/her own development into self-reliant, supportive, responsible and committed persons. Our Cub Scout Programme Scheme includes assessments in the areas of Citizenship, Leadership, Responsibility, Physical Skills, Self-Reliance, Adventure and Fun. An Award Scheme, comprising a series of badges to give cub scouts knowledge of basic Scouting skills and mark their achievements in areas such as camp craft, team-building games, citizenship and improving the environment is incorporated into the CCA programme.

The activities Cub Scouts partake in include hiking, camps, camp craft, and activities organised the Scout Headquarters.
