### Angklung / Kulintang Ensemble

The Angklung/Â  Kulintang Ensemble aims to nurture young musicians and seeks to develop good character through engaging experiences in the music.

The Angklung is a Balinese musical instrument which produces a note when shaken. It is made of bamboo and the music can be accompanied with kulintangs.

In the Angklung / Kulintang Ensemble, our students are exposed to a wide repertoire of music, both the traditional and the contemporary form. Our students demonstrate responsibility in taking good care and maintenance of their instruments. They show resilience while preparing for a performance, culminating in a harmonious performance on stage. Members have opportunities to develop their leadership potential and self-confidence.

Our young musicians have achieved outstanding achievements in Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation and have participated public performances, contributing to the community.
