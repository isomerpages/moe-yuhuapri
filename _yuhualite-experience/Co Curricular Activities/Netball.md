### Netball

**Overview**

Our Objectives:

1.  To encourage participation from the Primary 3 to Primary 6 girls of all abilities and to sustain their interest in netball.
2.  To continually develop our players on their technical and mental skills which are essential for netball.

Programme:  
Netball is a team sport that fosters team-spirit, trains agility and resilience. We aim to develop our players’ netball skills and nurture them to their fullest potential through our netball training that takes place twice a week. Players will be expected to compete at a level appropriate to their abilities in competitions and carnivals. Our players will strive to uphold the school values of a R3ICH attitude as well as to adopt an attitude of fair play and good sportsmanship in the game.

The Netball Club provides girls with an opportunity to participate in sports. Through the practices, members will improve in throwing and catching, shooting, and attack and defensive play. As they gain confidence in playing the game, they can take part in netball carnivals and Inter-Primary Schools Netball Championships.
