<h3>Angklung / Kulintang Ensemble</h3>
<p>The Angklung/&nbsp; Kulintang Ensemble aims to nurture young musicians
and seeks to develop good character through engaging experiences in the
music.</p>
<p>The Angklung is a Balinese musical instrument which produces a note when
shaken. It is made of bamboo and the music can be accompanied with kulintangs.</p>
<p>In the Angklung / Kulintang Ensemble, our students are exposed to a wide
repertoire of music, both the traditional and the contemporary form. Our
students demonstrate responsibility in taking good care and maintenance
of their instruments. They show resilience while preparing for a performance,
culminating in a harmonious performance on stage. Members have opportunities
to develop their leadership potential and self-confidence.</p>
<p>Our young musicians have achieved outstanding achievements in Singapore
Youth Festival Arts Presentation and have participated public performances,
contributing to the community.</p>
