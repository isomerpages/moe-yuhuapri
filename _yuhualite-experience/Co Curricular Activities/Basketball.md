<h3>Basketball</h3>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The Basketball Club aims to 1) cultivate members’ interest in basketball,
2) develop members’ skills in basketball and nurture talented players and
stretch their potential, 3) develop in our members the six school values
as well as social emotional competencies and 4) improve members’ physical
fitness.</p>
<p>Through the practices, members extend what they have learnt during PE
lessons and become more proficient basketballers. Players get the chance
to take part in friendly games to build their confidence and acquire experience
in competitive play.</p>
<p>The fitness and conditioning activities and other extensive specialised
training activities will prepare those with talents in basketball for competitions
at the national level, i.e. Inter-Primary Basketball Championships.</p>
