### Basketball

#### Overview

The Basketball Club aims to 1) cultivate members’ interest in basketball, 2) develop members’ skills in basketball and nurture talented players and stretch their potential, 3) develop in our members the six school values as well as social emotional competencies and 4) improve members’ physical fitness.

Through the practices, members extend what they have learnt during PE lessons and become more proficient basketballers. Players get the chance to take part in friendly games to build their confidence and acquire experience in competitive play.

The fitness and conditioning activities and other extensive specialised training activities will prepare those with talents in basketball for competitions at the national level, i.e. Inter-Primary Basketball Championships.
