### Learning for Life Programme (LLP)

**Overview**

In 2014, our Music and Performing Arts programme was awarded the recognition by MOE as a Distinctive Programme under the Learning for Life Programme (LLP). The LLP aims to provide opportunities for Yuhualites to build good character and nurture the 21st century competencies through Music and Performing Arts. Through the LLP programme, Yuhualites are able to develop greater pupil ownership in making creative decisions as they express themselves through music-composition and performing.

The school recognises the importance of Music education in nurturing a well-rounded individual and the opportunities that Music curriculum can provide in preparing Yuhualites for life. The school’s strong Music programme has provided the foundation for our Brass Band to attain our PSE status since 2011. Over the years, our other Performing Arts CCAs which include Chinese Dance, Malay Dance, Indian Dance, Choir and Angklung Ensemble also provided strong platforms for pupils to develop their interests and showcase their talents in these areas.

The objectives of the school’s Music programme are to:

*   Understand music concepts, and be able to create and improvise music
*   Discern and appreciate music of different cultures and genres.

Apart from developing skills, interest and talents of Yuhualites, our Music programme, supported by the Performing Arts programme, also focuses on building good character in our pupils and nurturing the 21st century competencies. To achieve this, we have put in place practices that leverage on strong pupil-centric orientation and encourage critical and creative thinking.

The four practices are:

*   Enhancing pupils’ musical understanding through creative and collaborative work
*   Empowering pupils through creative and collaborative composition
*   Developing pupils’ critical thinking through music-making
*   Nurturing pupils’ sense of citizenship through active community engagement.

Music and Performing Arts Programmes

In customising the Music and Performing Arts programme to inspire Yuhualites to explore their talents in music and encourage them to express themselves confidently through music, the school has put in place unique school-based programmes which adopts a 3-tier approach of Engage, Enrich and Excel.
