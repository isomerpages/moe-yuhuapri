### Malay Language

#### Overview

The department aims to develop pupils who can communicate effectively and confidently in their Malay language and are able to appreciate the language and culture.

**Key Programme**

**Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Fortnight**

MTL Fortnight held each year aims to create a learning environment where pupils learn more in depth about their culture. During the two week programme, pupils will have the opportunity to experience the Malay Language as a living language through the various hands-on activities.

**Conversational Malay Language**

The Conversational Malay Programme is conducted in school for non-Malay pupils who are interested in learning Malay language and culture. Through this programme, pupils will be able to converse in simple everyday Malay Language. This programme will also help pupils to enhance their rapport with Malay-speaking friends.

**Structured Reading Programme**

The aim of the structured reading programme is to develop pupils’ interests and reading habits as well as to increase student awareness and appreciation of their own culture. Through extensive reading, the pupils will be able to master the language and broaden their vocabulary. Suitable reading materials and activities are selected to enhance their learning of the language.

**Internal and External Competitions**

Internal competitions are conducted during the Mother Tongue Fortnight Week. Pupils can showcase their talents through these competitions. These competitions also provide additional opportunities for all pupils to further strengthen their language abilities

Aside from the school-based competition, pupils are also encouraged to participate in external competitions. This will help pupils to build up their confidence and contribute to their repertoire of experiences.

**Leveraging on ICT to Promote Joy of Learning**

Pupils are exposed to application tools such as ‘ChatterPix’ and ‘Flipgrid’ to record their experiences and responses based on topics assigned to them. Pupils explore their creativity as they personalise and design their submissions through these application tools. ICT-based lessons such as this allows pupils to build their confidence and interest to converse in Malay Language.

**Effective Questioning to Develop Critical Thinking Skills**

To promote critical thinking, teachers incorporate Elements of Thought (EOT) in their lessons. Through meaningful conversations and quality questioning, pupils’ critical thinking skills are deepened. This approach also allows students to build their vocabulary and confidence to converse in Malay Language.
