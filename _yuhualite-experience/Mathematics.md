### Mathematics

**Overview**

In Yuhua Primary School, the primary aim of the Mathematics curriculum is to develop students’ numeracy, thinking, reasoning, application skills and problem solving skills. It is also our aim for the pupils to acquire the necessary Mathematical concepts and skills for everyday life, develop the necessary process skills for the acquisition and application of mathematical concepts and skills and to build confidence and foster interest in mathematics. Most importantly, we would like our pupils to appreciate the value of mathematics in making choices and decisions in life.

Our Mathematics lessons and programmes focus on rich constructed experiential learning of math concepts and creating opportunities for pupils to develop 21st competencies, promoting self –directed and collaborative learning through ICT –based lessons and citizenship and character development (CCE).

We believe that every child is unique and we use a repertoire of problem solving strategies and approaches to help each child learn best to his or her ability.

**Promoting Joy of Learning of Mathematics**

**FAME Corner**

FAME corner stands for Free Access Math Experience corner! Affectionately known as FAME, this corner provides logic games for playing during recess time. New games are introduced monthly During the post-exam period, competitions like Kahoot!, rubix cubes and Sudoku are available for pupils to experience maths in a fun and engaging way. Pupils can also participate in quizzes during the festive seasons, e.g. Hari Raya quiz.

**Outdoor learning experience (OLE)**

OLE programme aims to provide opportunities for pupils to see mathematics outside the classroom. These OLE lessons packages are the brain child of our mathematics teachers. The needs and interests of our pupils are considered when designing these lessons. Our mathematics teachers brainstormed on the topics that their pupils found challenging and that could be integrated with outdoor experiences. Problem solving and logical thinking were incorporated into the OLE activities which were carried out during the mathematics lessons.  OLE activities allow pupils to practise the Mathematics concepts in a meaningful real-life context. OLE activities were developed for all the levels from Primary 1 – Primary 6.

Here are some examples:

Primary 3 (Topic: Area and Perimeter)

Pupils find out the area of a badminton court using their 1-metre squares made out of newspapers.

Pupils investigate if there is a difference in the speeds of the lift when going up and going down.

**Lower Primary Games Day**

The Mathematics Department organised a Games Day in collaboration with the PE Department. Many game stations were set up where pupils could participate and solve problems through physical activities which required the use of mathematical concepts.  Pupils had lots of fun and at the same time, apply their mathematical knowledge to solve authentic problem.

**Programmes to enrich learning of Mathematics**

**Maths Olympiad Programme**

The Maths Olympiad Programme is offered to pupils who has shown potential and aptitude in the subject. The programme stretches across 10 sessions to stretch our pupils’ potential in Mathematics.

Selected pupils are being sent for national level Mathematics competitions and we are proud to present their 2019 achievements below:
