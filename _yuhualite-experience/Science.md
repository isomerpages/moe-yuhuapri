### Science

#### Overview

The Science experience of a Yuhualite has been crafted using a repertoire of pedagogy that develops the pupilâ€™s knowledge and skills with respect to the subject of Science. Pupils are constantly encouraged to apply their learning to make sense of the world through inquiry, as well as to make informed decisions that will positively impact their lives, society and the environment.

Through Meaningful, Experiential and Enriched experiences, the school aims to provide pupils with:

*   Knowledge, skills and character to achieve academic success in Science

*   A life-long passion for the subject and a desire to seek understanding through inquiry and apply their learning to their lives.

#### Programmes

The school Science Programmes are guided by the MOE Science Curriculum Framework. Central to the Framework is the conduct of Inquiry, founded on three integral domains of (a) Knowledge, Understanding and Application, (b) Skills & Processes and (c) Ethics & Attitudes. The curriculum design seeks to enable pupils to view the pursuit of science as meaningful and useful. Inquiry is thus grounded in knowledge, issues and questions that relate to the roles played by Science in daily life, society and the environment. Programmes and lessons are thus planned, in conjunction with the Elements of Thought, to develop the hearts and minds of our pupils with respect to the topic of Science.
