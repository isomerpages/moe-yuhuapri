### Pupil Leadership Development

In Yuhua Primary School, we believe that all Yuhualites can lead. We have in place a rigourous Pupil Leadership Development programme that seeks to inculcate in every yuhualite the knowledge, skills and values of a leader. Through our programme, we hope that all Yuhualites will develop into self-directed leaders who will seek constant improvement.

**Pupil Leadership Programme**

**In our school,  we use PINNACLE, which** is the acronym for **P**rogramme for **In**spiring & **N**urturing **A**ctive **C**onfident **Le**aders, in the designing of programme for different segments of the pupil leaders.

**All Yuhualites, from primary one to primary six, will go through the milestone programme.**  Cohort Leadership workshop is also carried out for the P4 and P5 cohorts. Through the milestone programme, the school believes that every pupil leader can and will develop the following leadership skills

*   Teamwork
*   Communications
*   Decision making
*   Conflict management
*   Engaging others

The Enhanced leadership programme is designed for Prefects, CCA Leaders and School Peer Supporters. Yuhualites are taught specific skills that are essential for them to carry out their leadership roles in school. Through the programme, they will also develop the habits of good leaders.

Additional programme and opportunities are also given to pupil leaders who demonstrates exceptional leadership to develop themselves into active confident leaders.

The school aspires to help develop all Yuhualite to become pupil leaders who can lead with a humble heart and an open mind.
