### Character & Citizenship Education

**Overview**

Centred on the mission to grow the hearts and minds of every Yuhualite, the school adopts a multi-faceted approach to engage pupils so that they learn to be responsible to family and community, and understand their roles in shaping the future of our nation.  Anchored on school values of Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care and harmony, the school creates learning opportunity that draw out and develop our students’ personal character strengths, as well as nurture in them our shared values.  In line with developing the character strengths of our students, our classes naming system follows the character strengths of Joy, Courage, Kindness, Gratitude, Diligence, Unity, Honesty and Love.

**CCE Form Teachers Guidance Period (FTGP)**

CCE(FTGP) are taught by all form teachers.  There is emphasis on explicit teaching on social-emotional competencies in CCE(FTGP) as the foundation for more complex conversations and discussions at Secondary levels and beyond.  Topics for developing citizenship dispositions are also taught in CCE(FTGP) to foster inter-ethnic understanding and appreciation for one another’s culture in a multicultural classroom setting.

**Awesome Character-building time (ACE)**

Form teachers play a central role in shaping the development of Yuhualites.  In addition to CCE(FTGP), the school’s in-house Awesome character-building timE (ACE) provide time within the curriculum to provide form teachers to engage in quality interactions with their students.  There are planned interactive activities between the form teachers and students to enhance bonding as well as the teaching of social and emotional learning skills.

**CCE Mother Tongue Languages CCE(MTL)**

CCE has been taught in the MTLs as they hold a rich source of knowledge for the transmission of values.  In addition, cultural stories unique to each MTL are selected to support the teaching and learning of values.  The teaching of CCE in MTL also provides additional exposure time so as to improve student’s competency in Chinese, Malay and Tamil.  CCE is important to all students, therefore those students who are exempted from MTL, will have CCE lessons in the English medium during the CCE(MTL) periods.

**National Education (NE) Commemorative Days**

Yuhualites commemorate the four NE Commemorative Days every year:

*   Total Defence Day (Term 1)
*   International Friendship Day (Term 2)
*   Racial Harmony Day (Term 3)
*   National Day (Term 3)

Through the NE commemorative days, Yuhulites learn about the important milestones of Singapore’s history and how they can play their part to keep Singapore a diverse, unified and resilient country.  These provide opportunities for Yuhualites to deepen their appreciation of our shared past and Singapore’s current realities.

**Values in Action (VIA)**

Values in Action (VIA) are learning experiences that support students’ development as socially responsible citizens.  Through VIA, Yuhualites have opportunities to learn and care about Singapore, demonstrate active citizenship, learn skills and values relating to working in groups and interacting with others in the public sphere.  As part of Everyday Responsibilities, Yuhualites develop a sense of responsibility and care for their own shared spaces through daily cleaning and adopting sustainable practices in school and at home.  They reflect on their experience, the values they have put into practice, and how they can continue to contribute meaningfully.
