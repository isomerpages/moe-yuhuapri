<h3>GPA Insurance Policy for Students</h3>
<h3><br><strong>Insurance Plan for Students 2026</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong> 
<br>A Master Contract for GPA has been established by MOE HQ since 2018. The
purpose is to reduce admin workload for schools and leverage on economies
of scale to obtain better coverage.
<br>All government and government aided schools have been included in the
cover and need not pay for the premium.</p>
<p><strong>Coverage</strong> 
<br>The Group Personal Accident (GPA) Insurance for Students covers death,
permanent and total/partial disability and medical expenses. The triggering
causes of injuries&nbsp;<strong>must be attributed to an accident</strong>.</p>
<p>The GPA Insurance for Students&nbsp;<strong>does not cover for pre-existing conditions</strong>.
<br>The GPA Insurance covers each student when the student is
<br>In his or her school;</p>
<p>Participating in the&nbsp;<strong>school’s activities, or any activity related to the school</strong>,
including home-based learning and blended learning, Co-Curricular Activities
(“CCAs”) and sports, regardless of the time at which such activities are
conducted and whether the activity is conducted in the school, in Singapore,
or elsewhere;</p>
<p><strong>Commuting</strong>&nbsp;from (or to) his or her place of residence,
including a hostel, to (or from) either the school’s premises or the place
where an activity covered by the GPA Insurance will be conducted, including
any reasonable deviations. For the avoidance of doubt, the Student’s place
of residence may include a place that is not in Singapore.</p>
