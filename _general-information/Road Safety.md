### Road Safety

Pupils’ safety is of the utmost importance. Pupils must always be vigilant and exercise proactive measures when they are on the roads. The following road safety guidelines should be observed by all pupils:

*   Always cross the road at designated pedestrian crossings, overhead bridges, underpasses or zebra crossings, even if you have to walk a longer distance. Use the Kerb Drill to ensure that you are visible to the motorists.

*   At the pedestrian crossing, start to cross the road only after all the vehicles have stopped.

*   Always be alert for inattentive drivers even at signalised crossings.

*   Always walk along the footpaths.
