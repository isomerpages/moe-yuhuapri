### Information on Assessment

#### Primary 1 & 2 Assessment

Since 2019, there has been no weighted assessments for P1 and P2 pupils. Schools have removed P1 Mid-Year Examination (MYE) and End-of-Year Examination (EYE), and P2 MYE since 2009. Building on these changes as part of PERI Holistic Assessment, schools have also removed P2 EYE in 2019. The school will use subject-specific learning outcomes (LO) and qualitative descriptors to report P1 and P2 pupils’ learning progress for all subjects at the end of Semester 1 and Semester 2. These will provide feedback to parents on the pupils’ progress and learning through the different modes of assessment completed by pupils. Detailed information of these unweighted assessment tasks will be provided at the beginning of each term. A holistic development profile (HDP) and portfolio will be given to parents of P1 and P2 pupils at the end of each semester.

The school recognises the importance of encouraging pupils to focus on growth and mastery so that we can focus on building pupils’ confidence and intrinsic motivation to learn at an early stage, particularly at lower primary levels. These changes build on efforts to inculcate joy of learning as it will allow for deepening of learning, holistic development and pupils’ self-discovery.

#### Primary 3 to 6 Assessment

In 2020, P3 pupils will have termly Review Tests in Term 2 and Term 3; and EYE in Term 4. There will be no MYE for P3 in Term 2. P4 and P5 pupils will have Review Tests in Term 1 and Term 3, and MYE and EYE in Semester 1 and Semester 2 respectively. P6 pupils will have their Review Test in Term 1, MYE in Term 2 and Preliminary Examination in Term 3. All Primary 6 pupils will sit for the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) at the end of their primary education. Posting to secondary school is based only on the PSLE results.
