### Highlights for 2020

**President’s Visit @ Yuhua 2020**

We are very honoured to share that our President, Mdm Halimah Yacob, visited Yuhua Primary School on 11 November 2020. During her visit, Mdm President had the opportunity to observe the P2 and P6 recess activities which emphasize positive relationships. Mdm President also visited our P2 students Coding lesson with Awbie and Cyberwellness and P5 Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) on developing peer support skills.

Mdm President’s visit ended with an interaction session with some of our peer supporters who shared with Mdm President their experiences. Mdm President was presented with a Cyber Wellness advocacy poster, designed by our Cyber Wellness Safety Ambassadors (CWSAs). The visit was featured in the news on Channel NewsAsia and in the newspapers such as Lianhe Zaobao and Berita Harian.

Thank you Mdm President for visiting Yuhua Primary School.

#### Vertical Farming

The second floor walkway&nbsp; above the Science Garden has now been repurposed into an area to&nbsp;support learning and literally bring new life and experiences for our Yuhualites. The area now houses two sets of Vertical Farms, able to&nbsp;grow and support vegetable crops that would usually need many more times the land space in traditional farms.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the future, Yuhualites would have the opportunity to experience this for themselves – to be responsible and resilient in taking care of their crops and enjoying the harvest of their labour, using a technology that has zero wastage, zero pesticides and pollutants, using minimal energy and water.

### Yuhualites in the Community

On 1 February, our Yuhualite Chinese Dance group performed at the Yuhua&nbsp;CC Chinese New Year Mega Toss dinner event attended by Guest-of-Honour,&nbsp;Ms Grace Fu, MP for Yuhua SMC.

Our school’s Aesthetic Team teachers and Yuhualites from Primary 3 and 4 handmade  
over 400 Chinese New Year – themed get-well-soon cards for patients at Ng Teng Fong and Jurong Community Hospital.

Our Primary Two and Upper Primary Yuhualites spent&nbsp;time and effort to fold origami cranes and hearts&nbsp;which symbolise well wishes and good luck. These&nbsp;were made into art pieces that were presented to&nbsp;Medico Clinic and the Wu Clinic on 30 June 2020.  
This gesture represented our Yuhualites’ heartfelt&nbsp;gratitude to the healthcare workers for fighting&nbsp;against COVID-19 in the frontlines.

#### Photo Journalism

Learning took a different slant when the 2019 cohort of Primary 6 Yuhualites underwent a&nbsp;photojournalism workshop. The objective was to equip pupils with basic photography skills so&nbsp;as to capture pictures of places and objects around the school that carried special memories for&nbsp;them.&nbsp;Some of their best work have been compiled into photobooks and these are available in the&nbsp;Media Resources Library for fellow Yuhualites to browse.

#### Home Base Learning

The month-long full Home-Based Learning (fHBL) period&nbsp;which started on 8 April posed a steep learning curve&nbsp;for everyone. While the practice day in the week of 1 April gave us an idea of what to expect, FHBL came with&nbsp;its own set of challenges. Nevertheless, it was a time of&nbsp;learning for students and teachers alike. Stay home, stay  
safe, stay curious – How did we do that?

#### Deepavali

The Deepavali celebration at Yuhua was held on 29&nbsp;October 2019, a day after our Hindu friends celebrated&nbsp;their special day.

#### Chinese New Year

Excitement filled the air as we celebrated&nbsp;Chinese New Year together on 24 February 2020. Students learn how traditional practices&nbsp;take on a modern twist with the use of technology.

#### Hari Raya

This year’s Hari Raya Aidilfitri was truly one to remember,&nbsp;falling right in the midst of the Circuit Breaker period. Even&nbsp;with safe distancing measures and restrictions put in place,  
everyone’s festive spirits were not dampened. Our Muslim&nbsp;friends made good use of technology, by ordering festive&nbsp;supplies online to prepare for the festivities, as well as keeping&nbsp;in touch with family and friends through video calls. Through&nbsp;mutual understanding, respect and resilience, everyone&nbsp;was able to celebrate Hari Raya safely while observing safe&nbsp;distancing measures.

#### Racial Harmony Day

On 14th July 2020, Yuhualites commemorated Racial Harmony&nbsp;Day. The theme for this year was Multiculturalism. Yuhualites&nbsp;were encouraged to embrace the diversity of our various&nbsp;ethnic cultures that together make us Singaporean.

#### National Day

On 7 August, Yuhualites commemorated National Day.&nbsp; As part of the celebrations, our Yuhualites were encouraged to contribute food which was then packed as gifts to be  
distributed to families who needed support. The response was overwhelming and the school managed to prepare over&nbsp;100 gift packs. These packs were then given to our partner, Yuhua Senior Activity Centre and Loving Heart (Social&nbsp;Service Agency in Yuhua Constituency) for distribution to the families who needed support.

#### TDD Complete / International Friendship Day

Due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, TDD was celebrated differently this year. Our  
Yuhualites were introduced to the Soaper 5 and the Wipe-Down routine.

For the very first time, a joint celebration of the Arts Festival and International Friendship Day was held virtually&nbsp;during the Circuit Breaker period. The theme for this year’s celebration was “Beyond Borders”. The importance&nbsp;of maintaining friendly relations among ASEAN countries was emphasized through videos, sing along sessions  
and even an art competition.

#### Annual Prize Giving

Our 37th Annual Prize-Giving Day (APGD) was held on 17 July this year. The theme ‘Dare to Dream’ clearly resonated&nbsp;with our students. Students from P4 to P6 joined in the Prize-Giving Day by tuning in to the live broadcast from&nbsp;their classrooms. As the students watched their friends receive their awards, rapturous applause echoed from the&nbsp;classrooms.
