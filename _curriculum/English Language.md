<h3>English Language</h3>
<p><strong>Overview</strong>
</p>
<p>The English Language Syllabus 2020 (Primary) emphasizes the progressive
development, reinforcement, and extension of language skills through meaningful
and engaging learning experiences. It promotes a love for reading, encourages
extensive language use, and leverages oracy, reading, and writing to build
knowledge and foster independent, confident language users.</p>
<p>The diagram below presents the key features of the EL Syllabus 2020.</p>

<p>The ELS 2020 aims to develop 21st century skills and emerging competencies
in our students and nurture them to be empathetic communicators, discerning
readers and creative inquirers.</p>

<p>The English Language Syllabus 2020 emphasizes the importance of multiliteracies
in enabling students to make and create meaning using diverse semiotic
modes across print, visual, audio and digital platforms. By engaging with
multimodal and hybrid texts, students develop not only linguistic competence
but also media, visual and information literacy skills, preparing them
to navigate the complexities of communication in a digitally connected
and culturally diverse world.</p>

<p><strong>Our Vision</strong>
</p>
<p>To nurture Communicative and Confident Learners through the development
of speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills.</p>
<p><strong>Our Mission</strong>
</p>
<p>We aim to build a strong foundation in the English Language among our
Yuhualites while providing rich, meaningful, and enjoyable learning experiences
that foster a lifelong love for the language.</p>
<p><strong>Curriculum Approach</strong>
</p>
<p>The school adopts the <strong>STELLAR</strong> (Strategies for English Language
Learning and Reading) approach as the cornerstone of our English Language
teaching. STELLAR aims to cultivate a love for reading and strengthen language
skills through engaging, student-centred learning experiences.</p>
<p><strong>LOWER PRIMARY STELLAR</strong>
</p>
<p>The Lower Primary STELLAR Pedagogical Model comprises the following strategies:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Shared Book Approach (SBA)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning Centre Activities (LC)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Shared Book Approach (SBA) provides a shared reading experience for teachers
to model the reading process and for students to participate actively in
the reading. During the first reading, the teacher reads a big book together
with students, discussing concepts of print as well as questions about
the book being read. In subsequent readings, the teacher teaches target
vocabulary and language structures explicitly, as well as other target
skills such as concepts of print and phonics. Based on the book being read,
teachers may also carry out a range of follow-up activities like speech
and drama, music and art.</p>
<p>Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA) provides students with a
shared experience that is linked to the big book read during SBA lessons.
The shared experience provides the context and content for students to
think and talk about, using the specific language structures and vocabulary
they have acquired during the SBA lessons. The teacher facilitates discussions
for a piece of group writing before the students progress to pair writing
and then individual writing.</p>
<p>Learning Centre Activities are a key component of the Lower Primary STELLAR
curriculum. They offer hands-on and engaging tasks that reinforce language
skills taught during SBA and MLEA lessons, allowing students to learn at
their own pace in a differentiated setting.</p>
<p>To extend classroom learning, students also participate in Learning Journeys
to the Singapore Zoo and the S.E.A. Aquarium, making learning come alive
through real-world connections and experiencing the joy of discovering
new things beyond the classroom.</p>

<p><strong>MIDDLE PRIMARY AND UPPER PRIMARY STELLAR</strong>
</p>
<p>The Middle Primary and Upper Primary STELLAR Pedagogical Model consists
of the following strategies:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Sustained Silent Reading (SSR)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supported Reading (SR)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Know-Want to Know-Learnt (KWL)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retelling (RT)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writing Process Cycle (WPC)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Differentiated Instruction (DI)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sustained Silent Reading (SSR) is regularly practised. Everyone in the
classroom reads a book of his/her choice quietly and uninterrupted for
ten minutes a day. This provides students with authentic opportunities
to enjoy reading while practising their silent reading skills.</p>
<p>Supported Reading (SR) provides a bridge between teacher-supported reading
aloud and independent silent reading. It provides opportunities for students
to make predictions, read sections of the text silently, discuss the text
and unfamiliar words used in context as a whole class.</p>
<p>Know-Want to Know-Learnt (KWL) is used mainly for non-fiction texts. This
strategy helps students to extract information and relate it to what they
already know about the topic. Teachers guide students to organise, access
and remember information from texts read.</p>
<p>Retelling (RT) is a reading comprehension strategy that engages students
at different levels of language – from interpreting meaning at the whole
text level, to individual words and phrases, and back to the whole text
again. It provides opportunities for all the major language skills to be
applied as students actively make meaning of texts and share their understanding
with their peers.</p>
<p>Writing Process Cycle (WPC) builds on the principles of the MLEA and continues
to provide students with guidance in the processes of idea generation,
idea selection, idea development, idea organization, review and editing
before they apply the skills in writing independently.</p>
<p>Differentiated Instruction (DI) provides students with differentiated
support at various points of instruction to optimize their learning. Appropriate
activities are designed to support, reinforce and extend students’ learning
in reading, writing, oracy, word study, grammar and language use.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Learning Support Programme (LSP)</strong>
</p>
<p>Believing that every child can learn well at his or her own pace, the
Learning Support Programme (LSP) provides enhanced support to selected
students in basic literacy skills to enable them to access learning in
the regular classroom. The LSP is a specialized early intervention programme
aimed at providing learning support to students who enter Primary 1 with
weak English Language and literacy skills. Students are identified for
LSP through a systematic screening process which is carried out at the
beginning of Primary 1.</p>
<p><strong>School-based Dyslexia Remediation Programme (SDR)</strong>
</p>
<p>School-based Dyslexia Remediation Programme is a two-year intervention
programme for Primary 3 and 4 students. These students are identified for
support through a systematic screening process for dyslexia conducted at
the end of Primary 2. The programme is conducted in small groups by our
trained school personnel using a remediation curriculum designed by MOE
Reading Specialists.</p>
<p><strong>Reading Remediation Programme (RRP)</strong>
</p>
<p>The Reading Remediation Programme is aimed at supporting Primary 3, 4
and 5 students who require more support in reading in the English Language.
The programme exposes the students to a range of coping strategies for
reading comprehension, word recognition and oral reading fluency which
will enable them to better manage their daily learning.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>READ Period</strong>
</p>
<p>At Yuhua Primary, our weekly <strong>READ Periods</strong> are specially
designed to nurture a vibrant reading culture and support our students'
development as confident, reflective readers.</p>
<p>The <strong>READ programme</strong> is guided by clear goals at each level:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>P1–P2</strong>: <em>Read for Enjoyment</em> –
fostering a love for reading through engaging stories and fun literary
activities.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>P3–P4</strong>: <em>Read for Information</em> –
encouraging students to explore diverse texts and acquire knowledge through
reading.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>P5–P6</strong>: <em>Read for Growth</em> –
developing deeper thinking and personal reflection through more complex
and meaningful texts.</p>
<p>During READ Periods, Yuhualites are exposed to a wide range of literary
genres, including mystery, fiction, and adventure. Through guided exploration
of key genre features, students develop a deeper appreciation for storytelling
and literary expression.</p>
<p>To foster critical thinking, the programme incorporates the <strong>Elements of Thought </strong>and <strong>Thinking Routines</strong>,
equipping students with the tools to question, reflect, and make meaningful
connections with texts. Reader-response tasks further deepen engagement,
allowing students to respond creatively and thoughtfully to their reading.</p>
<p>From Middle to Upper Primary, students exercise greater autonomy by selecting
tasks that appeal to their interests—such as designing a book cover or
composing a letter to the author—thereby promoting self-directed learning
and ownership.</p>
<p>Ultimately, READ nurtures discerning and independent readers who engage
with texts purposefully and with enjoyment, laying a strong foundation
for lifelong learning.</p>

<p><strong>Monthly Current Affairs</strong>
</p>
<p>At Yuhua Primary School, we aim to nurture students with a broad and informed
worldview. Through our <em>Monthly Current Affairs</em> programme, Yuhualites
are exposed to a variety of global topics that encourage awareness and
critical thinking. Each month features a new theme, and students engage
in class discussions where they are invited to share their perspectives
and reflect on real-world issues.</p>
<p><strong>Supplementary Materials: Story Time, OWL, WHIZ, National Geographic, What’s Up, iKnowledge</strong>
</p>
<p>To support and enrich learning, a range of carefully selected magazines
is used during English Language lessons. These publications are tailored
to our students’ reading levels and designed to spark curiosity, promote
critical thinking, and deepen understanding of both local and global issues.
The content is current, engaging, and relevant—ensuring students can connect
with the material in meaningful ways.</p>

<p><strong>SPEAK@Yuhua:</strong>
</p>
<p>At Yuhua Primary School, we offer various programmes and activities to
develop our students' speaking abilities and boost their confidence in
communication.</p>
<p><strong>Yu-Trendz</strong>
</p>
<p>Yu-Trendz is our initiative designed to develop confident speakers through
two platforms:</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Digital Platform</strong>
</p>
<p>The Yu-Trendz Padlet serves as an interactive digital platform for students
to showcase their ideas, experiences, and creative expressions through
video responses to curated prompts. It fosters peer engagement and authentic
voice, and sees heightened activity during key school events and celebrations.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recess Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>This year, the Yu-Trendz recess activities have been thoughtfully designed
to provide Yuhualites with authentic opportunities to develop their oracy
skills. Through engaging tasks such as tongue twisters and news reporting,
selected from the Yu-Trendz Choice Board, students are empowered to build
confidence and strengthen their spoken communication in a fun and purposeful
manner.</p>
<p><strong>External Speaking Opportunities</strong>
</p>
<p>We actively encourage our verbally talented students to participate in
external peaking competitions, providing them with valuable platforms to
showcase and enhance their oracy skills:</p>
<p><strong><em>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SPEAK Up! Competition</em></strong>
</p>
<p>This annual competition, organized by Speech Academy Asia, offers our
students the chance to collaborate with peers whilst developing their public
speaking abilities.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Yu_Trendz.png">
</div>
<p>Through this platform, our talented Yuhualites express their unique perspectives
and inspire others with their ideas.</p>
<p><strong><em>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wits &amp; Words: Inter-school Debate Championship</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Co-organised by the Gifted Education Branch and Nanyang Girls' High School,
this championship enables our budding debaters to sharpen their critical
thinking skills while engaging with peers from other schools in stimulating
debates.</p>
<p><strong><em>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mythos (Junior Orators)</em></strong>
</p>
<p>This storytelling competition, hosted by the Anglo-Chinese Junior College
(ACJC) Debate and Oratorical Society, provides an excellent platform for
our students to showcase and enhance their narrative skills and creative
expression.</p>
<p><strong><em>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; YMCA Plain English Speaking Awards (PESA)</em></strong>
</p>
<p>This prestigious national competition, organized by YMCA of Singapore
and supported by the Ministry of Education (MOE) and Speak Good English
Movement (SGEM), offers our students the opportunity to refine their public
speaking abilities and build self-assurance in a competitive environment.</p>

<p><strong>Language Level Competitions</strong>
</p>
<p>To celebrate the end of examinations, our Yuhualites would have a language
level competition. Our Yuhualites played word games such as Spelling Bee
or Scattergories. It was a happy way to relax, have fun with friends, and
celebrate their hard work.</p>
