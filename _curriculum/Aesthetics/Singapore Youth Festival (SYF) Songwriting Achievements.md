**Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Goes Online**

In the year 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, SYF was conducted online instead. Although SYF could not take place physically this year, it was still a meaningful and enriching experience for all the participants. Our student, Meilsa, took part in the competition with her father and performed to the song “We Will Get There” to encourage everyone to press on during this trying period. The school is proud to announce that the performance by Meilsa and her father clinched the Top 10 position. Well done Meilsa!
