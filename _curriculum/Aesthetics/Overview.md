<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Our Aesthetics programme aims to provide opportunities for Yuhualites
to understand and appreciate the various genres of Music and Visual Art,
and for them to express themselves creatively. Through the Aesthetics programme,
Yuhualites are able to develop their interests and nurture their talents
in the performing and visual arts.</p>
<p>The school recognises the potential of Arts education in building good
character and nurturing 21st century competencies in our students. To achieve
this, the Aesthetics programme has in place practices that leverage on
strong student-centric orientation and provide opportunities for greater
student ownership in making creative decisions as they express themselves
through music-composition and art-making.</p>
<p>To deliver our Aesthetics programme, the school adopts a 3-tier approach
of Engage, Enrich and Excel.</p>
<p><strong>Music</strong>
</p>
<p>The school recognises the importance of music in nurturing a well-rounded
individual and the opportunities that Music curriculum can provide in preparing
Yuhualites for life. The school’s strong Music programme has provided the
foundation for our Brass Band to attain our PSE status since 2011. Over
the years, our other Performing Arts CCAs which include Chinese Dance,
Malay Dance, Indian Dance, Choir and Angklung Ensemble have also provided
strong platforms for students to develop their interests and showcase their
talents in these areas. In 2014, our Music and Performing Arts programme
was awarded the recognition by MOE as a Distinctive Programme under the
Learning for Life Programme (LLP).</p>
<p>The objectives of the school’s Music programme are to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Understand music concepts, and be able to create and improvise music;
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discern and appreciate music of different cultures and genres.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Music Key Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>In customising the Music programme to inspire Yuhualites to explore their
talents in music and encourage them to express themselves confidently through
music, the school has put in place unique school-based programmes, namely:</p>

<p><strong>Visual Art</strong>
</p>
<p>The objectives of the school’s Visual Art programmes are to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Develop sensory awareness and imagination</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acquire skills that enable students to describe and interpret artworks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create artworks to share their ideas, thoughts and feelings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand and value the art from variety of cultures and contexts</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For Primary 1 and Primary 2, the Visual Art Programme focuses on the fundamentals
of art techniques (drawing lines and shapes, and exploring colours). Yuhualites
are provided with hands-on, experiential aspects of art where they get
to ‘play’ and ‘explore’ different art media and art elements. For Primary
3 and Primary 4, students are ready to progress deeper in various art forms
and media. Students are introduced to paper mache as well as using ICT
as a platform to create artwork, for example. At Primary 5 and Primary
6, students are able to consolidate the art knowledge, skills and values
and are provided with more opportunities to develop skills like visual
inquiry, research and processing as well as communication during Art lessons.</p>
<p>At all the levels, the Visual Art Programme aims to achieve the key learning
outcomes through the framework of “Seeing”, “Expressing” and “Appreciating”.
Through the Visual Art Programme, the school hopes to nurture Yuhualites
who are visually literate and are able to appreciate art in the various
forms.</p>
