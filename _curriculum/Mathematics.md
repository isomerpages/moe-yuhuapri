<h3>Mathematics</h3>
<p><strong>Overview</strong>
</p>
<p>In line with Yuhua Primary School mission, Growing Our Hearts and Minds,
and the MOE Mathematics Curriculum to develop mathematical problem-solving
competency, Yuhua Primary School Mathematics Department mission aims to
develop Yuhualites to be resilient and collaborative problem solvers.</p>

</ul>
<p>Fostering a joy of learning in Mathematics is an important step to develop
resilient and collaborative learners. Activity-based learning approach
is adopted to encourage active student participation in the learning process
through hands-on activities, real-world applications, and experiential
learning. Our Outdoor Learning Experience (OLE) Programme is a key department
programme<strong> </strong>designed to give the lower and middle primary
Yuhualites the opportunity to experience mathematics in real-world contexts
beyond the traditional classroom setting. Each activity integrates problem-solving
and logical thinking, helping students learn collaboratively and overcome
challenges while applying mathematical concepts in meaningful, everyday
situations.</p>

<p>As Yuhualites move up to the upper primary, they will be involved in group
projects that allow them to use design thinking process and apply mathematical
concepts learnt to collaboratively problem-solve a given scenario.</p>

<p>To foster joy of learning through play, the Mathematics Department created
a unique corner in the school, the <strong>FAME corner</strong>, which stands
for Free Access Maths Experience corner. Affectionately known as FAME,
this corner provides logic games for playing during recess time. New games
are introduced monthly. During the post-exam period, competitions like
Blooket, Rubik’s cubes and Sudoku are available for Yuhualites to experience
Math in a fun and engaging way.</p>

<p>Besides the FAME corner, the Mathematics Department also gamified the
P3 to P6 WeCan Quizzes to make the learning of basic Mathematics facts
more engaging.</p>

<p><strong>Programmes to enrich learning of Mathematics</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Maths Olympiad Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The Maths Olympiad Programme is offered to students who has shown potential
and aptitude in the subject. The programme stretches across 10 sessions
to stretch our students’ potential in Mathematics.</p>
<p>Selected students are being sent for national level Mathematics competitions
and we are proud to present their 2019 achievements below:</p>
