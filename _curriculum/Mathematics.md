<h3>Mathematics</h3>
<p><strong>Overview</strong>
</p>
<p>In line with Yuhua Primary School mission, Growing Our Hearts and Minds,
and the MOE Mathematics Curriculum to develop mathematical problem-solving
competency, Yuhua Primary School Mathematics Department mission aims to
develop Yuhualites to be resilient and collaborative problem solvers.</p>

<p><strong>Developing Resilient and Collaborative Problem Solvers</strong>
</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Fostering a Joy of Learning in Mathematics</strong>
</p>
<p>Fostering a joy of learning in Mathematics is an important step to develop
resilient and collaborative learners. Activity-based learning approach
is adopted to encourage active student participation in the learning process
through hands-on activities, real-world applications, and experiential
learning. Our Outdoor Learning Experience (OLE) Programme is a key department
programme<strong> </strong>designed to give the lower and middle primary
Yuhualites the opportunity to experience mathematics in real-world contexts
beyond the traditional classroom setting. Each activity integrates problem-solving
and logical thinking, helping students learn collaboratively and overcome
challenges while applying mathematical concepts in meaningful, everyday
situations.</p>

<p>To foster joy of learning through play, the Mathematics Department created
a unique corner in the school, the <strong>FAME corner</strong>, which stands
for Free Access Maths Experience corner. Affectionately known as FAME,
this corner provides logic games for playing during recess time. New games
are introduced monthly. During the post-exam period, competitions like
Blooklet, Rubik’s cubes and Sudoku are available for Yuhualites to experience
maths in a fun and engaging way.</p>

<p><strong>Outdoor learning experience (OLE)</strong>
</p>
<p>OLE programme aims to provide opportunities for Students to see mathematics
outside the classroom. These OLE lessons packages are the brain child of
our mathematics teachers. The needs and interests of our students are considered
when designing these lessons. Our mathematics teachers brainstormed on
the topics that their students found challenging and that could be integrated
with outdoor experiences. Problem solving and logical thinking were incorporated
into the OLE activities which were carried out during the mathematics lessons.&nbsp;
OLE activities allow students to practise the Mathematics concepts in a
meaningful real-life context. OLE activities were developed for all the
levels from Primary 1 – Primary 6.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<p>Primary 3 (Topic: Area and Perimeter)</p>
<p>Students find out the area of a badminton court using their 1-metre squares
made out of newspapers.</p>

<p>Primary 6 (Topic: Rate/ Speed)</p>
<p>Students investigate if there is a difference in the speeds of the lift
when going up and going down.</p>

<p><strong>Lower Primary Games Day</strong>
</p>
<p>The Mathematics Department organised a Games Day in collaboration with
the PE Department. Many game stations were set up where students could
participate and solve problems through physical activities which required
the use of mathematical concepts.&nbsp; Students had lots of fun and at
the same time, apply their mathematical knowledge to solve authentic problem.</p>

<p><strong>Programmes to enrich learning of Mathematics</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Maths Olympiad Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The Maths Olympiad Programme is offered to students who has shown potential
and aptitude in the subject. The programme stretches across 10 sessions
to stretch our students’ potential in Mathematics.</p>
<p>Selected students are being sent for national level Mathematics competitions
and we are proud to present their 2019 achievements below:</p>
