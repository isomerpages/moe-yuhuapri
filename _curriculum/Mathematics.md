<h3>Mathematics</h3>
<p><strong>Overview</strong>
</p>
<p>In line with Yuhua Primary School mission, Growing Our Hearts and Minds,
and the MOE Mathematics Curriculum to develop mathematical problem-solving
competency, Yuhua Primary School Mathematics Department mission aims to
develop Yuhualites to be resilient and collaborative problem solvers.</p>

<p>Fostering a joy of learning in Mathematics is an important step to develop
resilient and collaborative learners. Activity-based learning approach
is adopted to encourage active student participation in the learning process
through hands-on activities, real-world applications, and experiential
learning. Our Outdoor Learning Experience (OLE) Programme is a key department
programme<strong> </strong>designed to give the lower and middle primary
Yuhualites the opportunity to experience mathematics in real-world contexts
beyond the traditional classroom setting. Each activity integrates problem-solving
and logical thinking, helping students learn collaboratively and overcome
challenges while applying mathematical concepts in meaningful, everyday
situations.</p>

<p>As Yuhualites move up to the upper primary, they will be involved in group
projects that allow them to use design thinking process and apply mathematical
concepts learnt to collaboratively problem-solve a given scenario.</p>

<p>To foster joy of learning through play, the Mathematics Department created
a unique corner in the school, the <strong>FAME corner</strong>, which stands
for Free Access Maths Experience corner. Affectionately known as FAME,
this corner provides logic games for playing during recess time. New games
are introduced monthly. During the post-exam period, competitions like
Blooket, Rubik’s cubes and Sudoku are available for Yuhualites to experience
Math in a fun and engaging way.</p>

<p>Besides the FAME corner, the Mathematics Department also gamified the
P3 to P6 WeCan Quizzes to make the learning of basic Mathematics facts
more engaging.</p>

<p><strong>Encouraging Self-Reflection and Embracing a Growth Mindset</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To cultivate resilience in the learning of Mathematics in Yuhualites,
the Mathematics Department incorporated self-assessment component in every
Topical Review to promote deeper understanding of what they are learning,
encourage reflection and empower them to take ownership of their learning.
By actively assessing their own work, Yuhualites will gain a better understanding
of their strengths and weaknesses, identify areas for improvement, and
develop critical thinking and self-directed learning skills.</p>

<p>The Mathematics Department also initiated the Maths Buddy Programme to
build a strong support network of peers to provide a safe, collaborative,
and inclusive Mathematics learning culture, where students are encouraged
to help one another which strengthens academic progress and social bonds.
It also empowers Yuhualites from Primary 1 to Primary 6 to take on meaningful
leadership roles as Maths Buddies in the classroom. Maths Buddies are taught
not only to model resilience and problem-solving, but also to guide others
with thoughtfulness and encouragement. They are reminded that mistakes
are part of the learning process and that everyone learns at their own
pace. These meaningful interactions instill a sense of purpose and belonging
in both the helper and the helped.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Programmes to Enrich Learning of Mathematics</strong>
</p>
<p>Yuhualites who have demonstrated strong potential and aptitude in Mathematics
will be given the opportunity to join the Maths Olympiad Programme and
the E2K Maths Programme. The Maths Olympiad Programme programme is designed
to stretch students’ mathematical thinking and problem-solving abilities
beyond the standard curriculum, whereas the E2K Mathematics Programme aims
to develop students' mathematical reasoning skills and deepens their conceptual
understanding through an inquiry approach.</p>
<p>Participants are also given the opportunity to represent the school in
various Mathematics Olympiad competitions.
