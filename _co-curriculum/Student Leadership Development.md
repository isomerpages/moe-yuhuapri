<h3>Student Leadership Development</h3>
<p>In Yuhua Primary School, we believe that all Yuhualites can lead. We have
in place a rigourous Student Leadership Development programme that seeks
to inculcate in every yuhualite the knowledge, skills and values of a leader.
Through our programme, we hope that all Yuhualites will develop into self-directed
leaders who will seek constant improvement.</p>

<p><strong>In our school,&nbsp; we use PINNACLE, which</strong>&nbsp;is the
acronym for&nbsp;<strong>P</strong>rogramme for&nbsp;<strong>In</strong>spiring
&amp;&nbsp;<strong>N</strong>urturing&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>ctive&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>onfident&nbsp;<strong>Le</strong>aders,
in the designing of programme for different segments of the student leaders.</p>

<p><strong>Student Leadership Framework in Yuhua Primary School</strong> As
part of student leadership growth and development, the school’s student
leadership programme is anchored upon Stephen Covey’s 7 Habits of highly
effective people which is also in alignment to our <strong>ACHIEVE</strong> student
outcomes framework. The school’s programmes are divided into 3 tiers: Tier
1 - Leading Self, Tier 2 - Leading Peers and Tier 3 - Leading Teams/Others.
Aligned to our school vision of “Every Yuhualite who learns, thinks, innovates,
cares, shares and contributes”, we hope to nurture all students to flourish,
grow and demonstrate student leadership competencies as shown below.</p>
