<h3>ICT Programme</h3>
<p><strong>ICT in Teaching &amp; Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>ICT is an integral part of teaching and learning in YHPS. &nbsp;Across
subjects, teachers leverage ICT to enhance lessons, increase efficacy and
engage students with the purpose of deepening students' learning. We aim
to achieve quality ICT-enabled learning in every level and nurture students
with the appropriate dispositions to harness ICT for life-long learning.</p>
<p><strong>Baseline ICT Standards (New Media Literacies)</strong>
</p>
<p>The standards has its focus on the acquisition and application of technical
skills to support the creation of digital content and various modes of
interaction. It details the skills, knowledge, attitude and values (SKAV)
that students should apply and demonstrate when harnessing ICT for learning
and interacting; curating digital content; connecting and communicating
digitally; and creating digital multimodal products.</p>

</div>
<p>New Media Literacies have been defined as the abilities to curate, create
and connect with others in the digital networked environment. Curate, Create
and Connect are ways of interacting in the digital networked environment.
Regular engagement in these interactions will enable students to develop
an understanding of the social practices governing the digital networked
environment.</p>
<p>The six values at the core of MOE’s 21st&nbsp;Century Competencies Framework
undergird the values that students should have. These values shape their
participation in the digital networked environment.</p>
<p>The six values are:</p>

<p><strong>Developing Future-ready Learners</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>F.L.I.G.H.T.@1656</strong>&nbsp;is a signature two-pronged programme
that engages, enhances and extend students’ learning experiences. Students
get to synthesise their knowledge and create digital learning artefacts
that value-add to their learning. Customised tasks are curated to bring
forth level-appropriate New Media Literacies (Baseline ICT Standards),
Project Work Skills as well as English Language literacy application.</p>

<p><strong>F.L.I.G.H.T. 1,2,3!</strong>&nbsp;is the foundation of the whole-school
F.L.I.G.H.T.@1656 programme to drive ICT skills and innovative learning
experiences for the student. As this component targets the younger learners
in our school, we gave them a less abstract setting to work on and tap
on their learning content from their English Language curriculum as a springboard
to challenge them to more innovative learning experiences and outcomes.</p>

<p>The students here are working remotely to access shared documents and
give individual inputs, with their teacher’s assistance, to value-add to
a group task.</p>
<p><strong>F.L.I.G.H.T. 4,5,6!</strong>&nbsp;is the next stage to drive innovative
and critical thinking skills via coding-based lessons and challenges. As
students have had experience with F.L.I.G.H.T. 1,2,3!, we gave them a more
abstract setting to work on or with. Equipped with micro:bits, students
were given socio-environmental contexts to work with to bring forth empathy,
passion and critical thinking in their&nbsp;solutions generation.</p>

<p><strong>TechPlay 1,2,3!</strong>
</p>
<p>TechPlay 1,2,3! is the enrichment arm of the F.L.I.G.H.T. programme, aimed
at encouraging innovative and critical thinking through coding for the
Primary 1 to 3 students. Carried out at the year’s end, the students get
to experience coding via various means from tactile to line coding to enhance
their thinking processes and pique their interest in this area over the
formative years.</p>

<p><strong>Code for Fun (CFF) Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>This is an enrichment programme, jointly offered by IMDA and MOE, that
aims to increase primary and secondary students’ exposure to computational
thinking and making. It has been introduced to all Primary 5 students in
our school from 2020 through a 10-hour programme that aims to develop an
appreciation and interest in the core computational thinking and coding
concepts.</p>

<p>The students have coded these Sphero units to display icons that help
them to play the ‘Scissors, Paper, Stone’ traditional game in innovative
ways.</p>
<p><strong>Forging Ahead with Design Thinking @ InnoWizz</strong>
</p>
<p>InnoWizz is another signature programme in our school that enables a select
group of students to partake in Design Thinking and understand more about
effective yet affective problem-solving. This programme offers our students
the opportunities to delve deep into a designer’s mindset through exploring
and enabling the Design Thinking Framework and allows for the honing of
creative and critical thinking that are grounded by empathy. They learn
to be impactful contributors to tackle real-world issues.</p>

<p>With these varied and whole-school approach, a strong culture of innovation
and technological-readiness prevail among the students in the school.</p>
