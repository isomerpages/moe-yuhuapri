### Code for Fun (CFF)

**Overview**

During Code For Fun (CFF), students learnt about Computational thinking and how it could be applied to other aspects of their life. Basic programming skills and concepts such as events, loops, variables and functions were taught to the students.

The workshop also allowed students to develop logical thinking and problem-solving skills by breaking down problems into bite-sizes.

Throughout the lessons, students were given plenty of opportunities to work individually to program a dance using their Sphero robotic kits!

In the end, students ended off the 10-hour session with an introduction to Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Cyber Security.
