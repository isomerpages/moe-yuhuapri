WE STories is a collection of stories from all the secondary schools in the West Zone. 

Just as our lives are made up of stories and the stories we share with one another, every school has a fascinating story to share and an utterly unique perspective from which to tell it. 

Through each narrative, we hope to give fresh insights on the endeavours of each school in creating authentic learning experiences for our students.
