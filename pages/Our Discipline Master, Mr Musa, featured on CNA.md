We are proud to share that our HOD Student Management, also our Discipline Master, Mr Musa, was featured by CNA as part of a series where CNA reporters shadow various school professionals for a day. 

Through the article and video you can find out more about how the roles of Discipline Masters have changed over the years, and also have a flavour of how we better guide our children at Yuhua Primary to help them develop in character and be well-placed to flourish in life. 

Here is the CNA article and video links released on 19 Feb 2023 for your viewing pleasure.
