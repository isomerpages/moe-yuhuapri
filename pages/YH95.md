<h2><strong>Celebrating 95 Years of Excellence in Education: Our Journey from 1930 to 2025</strong></h2>
<p>From very humble beginnings to a beacon of educational excellence, Yuhua
Primary School's remarkable 95-year journey is a testament to the power
of community spirit and educational vision.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>A Legacy of Community Partnership</strong></h4>
<p>Our story began in 1930 when community leaders, local businessmen, and
residents of old Jurong came together with a shared dream that came true
as <em>Joo Hwa Public School</em>&nbsp;(公立裕华学校). Starting with just 100
students, our school provided Chinese-medium education to children from
the surrounding farming communities, laying the foundation for what would
become a cornerstone of education in Jurong East.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Rising Through Challenges</strong></h4>
<p>Though World War II temporarily halted our school’s operations, the school's
resilient spirit prevailed. Reopening in 1945, we witnessed such overwhelming
demand that a branch school at Old Day Road was established to accommodate
our growing Yuhua family. The 1951 renovation marked our commitment to
providing enhanced learning facilities for our students.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Evolution and Growth</strong></h4>
<p>The 1980s brought transformative changes. In 1979, we embraced bilingualism
by introducing English-medium classes. Two years later, we proudly became
Yuhua Primary School, and 1983 saw us establish our current home at Jurong
East Street 24.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Stronger Together</strong></h4>
<p>The 2002 merger with Yuqun Primary School marked the beginning of an exciting
new chapter. While honouring our rich heritage, we crafted a fresh identity
symbolised by our new uniform and school song. Our mission, "Growing Our
Hearts and Minds", continues to guide our educational journey.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Excellence in Education</strong></h4>
<p>Our commitment to holistic education reached new heights when our acclaimed
Brass Band programme was recognised by MOE as a Programme for School-based
Excellence in 2011, later evolving into our distinctive Learning for Life
Programme in Music and Performing Arts that provides our Yuhualites with
opportunities to explore their learning interests and hone their talents
in the Aesthetics while developing creative and inventive thinking anchored
in the value of resilience. Adding on to that in 2020, our distinctive
Applied Learning Programme which focuses on equipping students with E21st
Century Competencies to develop them to be critical thinkers, independent
learners, values-driven leaders and active contributors was also put in
place to grow the hearts and minds of our Yuhualites.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Celebrating 95 Years</strong></h4>
<p>As we mark our 95th anniversary in 2025, we celebrate not just our history,
but the thousands of students who have passed through our gates, the dedicated
educators who have shaped young minds, and the supportive stakeholders
and community that have been our support. Together, we look forward to
continuing our legacy of nurturing future generations of flourishing Yuhualites
with care, innovation and a Growth Mindset to ACHIEVE (i.e. our student
outcomes framework).</p>
<p>Join us throughout this year in 2025 as we commemorate this significant
milestone with special events, celebrations and learning activities that
honour our past while embracing our future.</p>
<p>We will share photographs and videos of our 95<sup>th</sup> School Anniversary
celebrations happening in April as well as ways you can participate or
keep abreast of our &nbsp;celebrations and learning activities via our
School’s Facebook and Instagram pages.</p>
