Our Annual Prize Giving Day (APGD) 2022 was conducted “live” via Zoom on 29 April this year for all parents and stakeholders to join in our celebrations! The theme for this year was, ‘Growing our Hearts and Minds’. With the Tin Man from the Wizard of Oz as our theme mascot, our students went on a discovery journey with him to revel in performances by our own Chinese, Indian and Malay Dance Groups, Angklung Ensemble and Brass Band, and also explore various activities that included making a Promise Box for themselves!
