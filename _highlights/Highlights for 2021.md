#### Annual Athletic Meet

Our Primary 3 to 6 Yuhualites took part in a modified Annual Athletic Meet held in school on 12 February this year.&nbsp; This was the first time since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic that the school was able to organise a mass participation event.

#### National Day Celebrations

Our Yuhualites gave back to the community by participating in Values-in-Action activities.&nbsp; With the “Gift-a-Pack Project” our Yuhualites pack donated food items into tote bags to be distributed to residents within the Yuhua community in line with the theme Together, Our Singapore Spirit.
